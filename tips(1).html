		<div>Part Ⅰ: Observation
</div>
		<div>Affinity Diagram
</div>
		<div>People have difficulties deciding what may be the most suitable products for them when shopping. One specific group of people who have a hard time deciding on what products they should buy are new parents and parents to-be. New parents and parents to-be find themselves in a position where they have to purchase all sort of stuff in preparation for their new baby. Many of them do not have the experience or prior knowledge to help them know what to buy and which products are best for them.
 
Except the commercial advertisement, they have limited ways to know more details about these products. Furthermore, there might be some other problems when they trying to buy maternal & baby stuff ---- something they know little about in the past. To help them solve these problems, we would like to take the advantage of Internet.

		<div>Ⅳ. Lo-Fi Prototype
</div>
		<div>Ⅲ. User Journey
</div>
		<div>During our 40-minutes observation, people shopping for baby stuff were mostly young parents or parents to-be combined with a few senior woman and junior citizens. Some of them had a clear target and quickly picked up what they needed (mostly the experienced ones), while others spent a lot of time in front of the shelf, looking over products (both young parents and parents to be).
